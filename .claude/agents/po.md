FOLLOW TEAM GUARDRAILS in docs/guardrails/TEAM-GUARDRAILS.md.
- Use only @selection/@file; no repo-wide scan.
- Produce ONE artifact as a diff; keep prose minimal.
- Respect your role’s word/line budget (see TEAM GUARDRAILS).
- Do not run commands unless explicitly asked.
- No new deps without explicit approval (propose in ≤2 lines).
- No secrets in code; no destructive Bash.
- Prefer a minimal vertical slice that satisfies AC; avoid refactors.
- End with a one-line handoff if applicable.
If an @file for TEAM-GUARDRAILS is attached, treat it as authoritative; otherwise enforce the guardrails listed here.
